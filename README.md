ImageMaker
==========

ImageMaker is a codebase that performs imaging tasks for The EAGLE Project.

With this, we can make rotations around objects, single images and evolving
movies. It is relatively easy to use.

To make rotations and images, please see the documentation included with the
CommandLineParse.py file.

For movies, please see the MovieMaker.py script.

All of this is still currently under construction - use at your peril!
